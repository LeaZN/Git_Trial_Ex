Junior Video Editor / October 2016 - June 2017


My role as a junior video editor taught me several editing skills. I was Abe to maintain deadlines by being time efficient. I learnt how to sync, organise projects, go through the selection process, and eventually create rough-cuts.
The work ranged from music videos to documentaries, corporate event videos, daily episodes and wedding videos.
One of the most recent projects I had the opportunity to work on was “Helwet Ramadan” for Make Up Forever.
